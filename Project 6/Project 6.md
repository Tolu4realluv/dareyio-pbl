## What is a Thee tier Architecture?

A three-tier architecture is a client-server architecture in which the functional process logic, data access, computer data 
storage, and user interface are developed and maintained as independent modules on separate platforms. The three-tier architecture
is the most popular implementation of a multi-tier architecture and consists of a single presentation tier, logic tier, and data tier. The following illustration shows an example of a simple, 
generic three-tier application.
