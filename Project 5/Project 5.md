## What is a Client/Server Architecture?

Client-server architecture is a computer network architecture in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer). Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns. Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them. Ideally, a server provides a standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients need not be aware of the specifics of the system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service. Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere on the network, usually on more powerful machines.

From the picture above, our Web Server has a role of a “Client” that connects and reads/writes to/from a Database (DB) Server (MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server or any other), and the communication between them happens over a Local Network (it can also be Internet connection, but it is a common practice to place Web Server and DB Server close to each other in local network).
