# WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (MERN STACK) IN AWS
---

## What is a Technology stack?
---
A stack is an arrangement of “things” kept in order one over the other. A technology stack is a set of technologies that are stacked together to build any application. Popularly known as a technology infrastructure or solutions stack, technology stack has become essential for building easy-to-maintain, scalable web applications.

Technology stack determines the type of applications you can build, the level of customizations you can perform, and the resources you need to develop your application.

For example, a web tech stack typically looks like:

There are acronymns for individual technologies used together for a specific technology product. some examples are…
* LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
* LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP or Python, or Perl)
* MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS)
* MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS, NodeJS

And for this project, we are implemenitng MERN stack solution.

## Connecting to the EC2 server through SSH
> NB: For this project, i already created an EC2 server on AWS, i just need to connect to it to start the implementation.


```ssh -i "mykey.pem" ubuntu@ec2-52-206-208-144.compute-1.amazonaws.com ```
